# CI/CD Workflow Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the required GitHub Actions workflows for the dynamic-moe-router-kit project.

## Required Workflows

### 1. Test Suite (`test.yml`)
**Trigger**: Push, Pull Request
**Purpose**: Run comprehensive test suite across Python versions and backends

```yaml
# Required test matrix:
python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11]
backend: [torch, jax, tf]
os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]

# Required steps:
- Setup Python environment
- Install dependencies with backend
- Run pytest with coverage
- Upload coverage reports
- Run performance benchmarks
- Cache dependencies
```

### 2. Code Quality (`lint.yml`)
**Trigger**: Push, Pull Request
**Purpose**: Enforce code quality standards

```yaml
# Required checks:
- black --check .
- isort --check-only .
- ruff check .
- mypy .
- pre-commit run --all-files
```

### 3. Security Scan (`security.yml`)
**Trigger**: Push, Pull Request, Schedule (weekly)
**Purpose**: Scan for security vulnerabilities

```yaml
# Required scans:
- CodeQL analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scan (safety)
- Secret scanning
- Container security (if applicable)
```

### 4. Documentation (`docs.yml`)
**Trigger**: Push to main, Pull Request
**Purpose**: Build and deploy documentation

```yaml
# Required steps:
- Build Sphinx documentation
- Check for broken links
- Deploy to GitHub Pages (main only)
- Generate API documentation
```

### 5. Release (`release.yml`)
**Trigger**: Tag push (v*)
**Purpose**: Automated package release

```yaml
# Required steps:
- Run full test suite
- Build wheel and sdist
- Publish to PyPI
- Create GitHub release
- Generate changelog
```

## Integration Requirements

### Branch Protection
- Require PR reviews (minimum 1)
- Require status checks (all workflows)
- Require up-to-date branches
- Restrict pushes to main

### Environment Variables
```yaml
# Required secrets:
PYPI_API_TOKEN: For package publishing
CODECOV_TOKEN: For coverage reporting
```

### Workflow Dependencies
- Security and lint checks must pass before merge
- Documentation must build successfully
- Full test suite required on release tags

## Performance Requirements

### Test Execution
- Maximum 20 minutes per workflow
- Parallel execution across matrix
- Fail-fast disabled for comprehensive testing

### Caching Strategy
- Cache pip dependencies
- Cache pre-commit environments
- Cache model weights for testing

## Notification Requirements

### Success Notifications
- Release workflow completion
- Documentation deployment

### Failure Notifications  
- Security vulnerability detection
- Release workflow failures
- Scheduled test failures

## Manual Setup Instructions

1. **Create `.github/workflows/` directory**
2. **Implement each workflow file based on requirements above**
3. **Configure branch protection rules in repository settings**
4. **Add required secrets to repository settings**
5. **Test workflows on feature branch before merging**

## Rollback Procedures

### Failed Release
1. Delete problematic tag
2. Fix issues in new commit
3. Re-tag and trigger release

### Broken Main Branch
1. Revert problematic commit
2. Create hotfix branch
3. Apply fix and merge via PR

This document serves as the implementation guide for setting up automated CI/CD workflows.
