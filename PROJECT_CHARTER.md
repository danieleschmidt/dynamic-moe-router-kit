# Project Charter: dynamic-moe-router-kit

## Executive Summary

The dynamic-moe-router-kit project aims to democratize efficient large language model inference through adaptive Mixture-of-Experts routing. By dynamically selecting experts based on input complexity, we achieve 30-40% FLOP reduction while maintaining model quality.

## Problem Statement

Current Mixture-of-Experts models use static routing, always activating the same number of experts regardless of input complexity. This leads to:
- Wasted computation on simple inputs
- Suboptimal resource utilization
- Higher inference costs
- Unnecessary energy consumption

## Solution Overview

A drop-in dynamic routing layer that:
1. Estimates input complexity in real-time
2. Adaptively selects the optimal number of experts
3. Maintains quality while reducing computation
4. Supports multiple ML frameworks (PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow)
