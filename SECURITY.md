# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow responsible disclosure:

### üîí Private Reporting (Preferred)

1. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/yourusername/dynamic-moe-router-kit/security/advisories/new)
2. **Email**: Send details to `security@yourcompany.com`
3. **Encrypted Communication**: Use our [PGP key](./docs/security/pgp-key.asc) for sensitive reports

### üìã What to Include

Please provide:
- Detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if known)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### üïê Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Triage Assessment**: Within 1 week  
- **Security Fix**: 2-4 weeks (depending on severity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed

## Security Measures

### üõ°Ô∏è Code Security

- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning with `bandit`
- **Dependency Scanning**: Vulnerability checks with `safety`
- **Secret Detection**: Pre-commit hooks prevent credential leaks
- **Code Review**: All changes require security-focused review

### üîê Supply Chain Security

- **Dependency Pinning**: All dependencies have version constraints
- **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials for transparency
- **Signature Verification**: Package integrity verification
- **Automated Updates**: Dependabot monitors for security patches

### üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Security

- **Container Scanning**: Docker images scanned for vulnerabilities
- **SLSA Compliance**: Build provenance and attestation
- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded secrets in repository
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest stable version
2. **Verify Downloads**: Check package signatures and hashes
3. **Isolate Environments**: Use virtual environments for dependencies
4. **Monitor Dependencies**: Regularly audit your dependency tree

### For Contributors

1. **Security Mindset**: Consider security implications of changes
2. **Secure Coding**: Follow [OWASP guidelines](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/)
3. **Dependency Review**: Evaluate new dependencies carefully
4. **Testing**: Include security test cases

## Known Security Considerations

### Model Security

- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all model inputs
- **Resource Limits**: Prevent DoS through resource exhaustion
- **Model Integrity**: Verify model weights and configurations
- **Privacy**: Handle sensitive data appropriately

### AI/ML Specific Risks

- **Adversarial Attacks**: Models may be vulnerable to crafted inputs
- **Data Poisoning**: Training data integrity is critical
- **Model Inversion**: Prevent extraction of training data
- **Bias and Fairness**: Monitor for discriminatory behavior

## Vulnerability Management

### Classification

We use the [CVSS v3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/) scoring system:

- **Critical (9.0-10.0)**: Immediate patch required
- **High (7.0-8.9)**: Fix within 1 week
- **Medium (4.0-6.9)**: Fix within 1 month  
- **Low (0.1-3.9)**: Fix in next minor release

### Disclosure Policy

- **Coordinated Disclosure**: Work with reporters before public release
- **CVE Assignment**: Request CVE for significant vulnerabilities
- **Public Advisories**: Publish security advisories post-fix
- **Changelog Updates**: Document security fixes clearly
