## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

2. **Email us directly** at security@example.com with:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if any)

3. **Wait for our response** - We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours

## Security Best Practices

When using this library:
- Keep dependencies updated

## Vulnerability Disclosure Process

1. **Initial Report** - Security issue reported privately
2. **Confirmation** - We confirm and assess the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development** - We develop and test a fix
4. **Coordinated Disclosure** - We release a fix and publicly disclose

We aim to resolve critical security issues within 30 days of disclosure.
