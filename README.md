# dynamic-moe-router-kit
dynamic-moe-router-kit implements adaptive expert routing for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, dynamically selecting the optimal number of experts per token based on input complexity. Based on the March 2024 arXiv paper showing dynamic routing boosts BBH reasoning while trimming FLOPs by up to 40%.
